# Get My Tweets

## Instructions

* In this activity, you will retrieve the most recent tweets sent out from your Twitter account using the Tweepy library.

  * Import the necessary libraries needed to talk to Twitter's API.

  * Import your keys from your `config.py` file.

  * Set up Tweepy authentication.

  * Write code to fetch all tweets from your home feed.

  * Loop through and print out tweets.

## Hint:

* Consult the [Tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/api.html?) documentation for the method used to accomplish this task.

## Bonus

* If you finish the activity early, try tweaking the parameters. For example, can you fetch ten tweets with the script? If you haven't yet sent out more than ten tweets from your account, do that first.
