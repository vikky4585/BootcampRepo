# Frequent Twitter Miles

Airlines get a lot of flack on Twitter, especially from celebrities and cultural icons. Let's see what tone the average Twitter user strikes when tweeting about them.

### Instructions

Retrieve and run a VADER sentiment analysis on 1000 tweets for each of the 7 popular airlines.

* Create an empty list to hold the results from each airline.

* Filter the tweets using the conditional filter variables provided.

* Create a "sentiment" dictionary for each airline that includes the search term and the averages of the compound, neutral, positive, and negative scores. Print this dictionary and append it to a list holding each airline's results.

* Create a DataFrame to display the results.

### HINTS

* Start with a subset of data for each airline while testing. Then, adapt your code to collect all 1000 tweets per airline.

* For a reference on using max_id, see this link: [Working with Timelines](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/guides/working-with-timelines)
