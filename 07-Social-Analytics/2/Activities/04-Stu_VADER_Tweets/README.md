## Twitter Analysis

In this activity, you will inspect the sentiment of a famous individual's tweets.

### Instructions

* Using the tweepy package, analyze the tweets from "@DalaiLama".

  * Analyze a total of 200 tweets. (How many tweets are on a page?)

  * Store the different scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound) in different lists.

  * Print the user's name and the mean of the following scores:

    * Compound

    * Positive

    * Neutral

    * Negative

### Bonus

* Compare the analysis to two other twitter accounts.  Display the results in a Pandas DataFrame.

* Feel free to use accounts of your own but remember you need to have at least 200 tweets.

* If you don't have an account or enough tweets, try using "@RealDonaldtrump" and "@Katyperry"
